# Contributor Guide

Welcome to the Guard module repository. This guide ensures new contributors can onboard quickly and confidently.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Review `.gitignore` to understand tracked vs ignored files.
3. Explore `schemas/` for validated JSON definitions.
4. Use `templates/` for demo-ready assets.
5. Run `make validate` to confirm schema compliance.
6. Review `VALIDATION_RULES.md` for schema and pipeline standards.

## Contribution Standards
- All schema changes must pass validation before commit.
- Templates must be demo-ready and clearly documented.
- Reports and outputs are ignored by Git; do not commit them.
